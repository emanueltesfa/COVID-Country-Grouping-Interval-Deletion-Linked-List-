# COVID Country Grouping & Interval Deletion <p>
### Description <p>
This program is written in java. It will prompt user to enter in a file to parse, must be "Countries3.csv". It will then be inserted into a 
doubly ended - doubly linked list for the queue and Double ended - singly linked list. From there the stack is loaded in by groups of CFR
(Covid-19 Fatality Rate). Then the queue is alternatively loaded (front, then back). Then the user will be prompted to choose a range to delete 
from the queue, ex. 0.025 and 0.035, the will be removed from queue. Again it will be alternatively loaded to stack and finally printed.
